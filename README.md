# Note-Taker-Extn

Minimalistic Chrome extension for note taking because I don't trust 3rd party extensions very much.

## Features

- Simple, privacy-focused note-taking directly in your browser
- No data leaves your device—notes are stored locally
- Lightweight and fast, with a clean popup interface

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" (top right).
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the project folder.

## Usage

- Click the Note-Taker icon in your Chrome toolbar.
- Type your notes in the popup and they will be saved automatically.
- Your notes persist between browser sessions.
